<h1> Stock-Price-Prediction</h1>
This project is focused on predicting stock prices using machine learning algorithms in Python. The main aim is to develop a model that can accurately predict future stock prices based on past data.

Getting Started
To get started with the project, you will need Python 3.x installed on your system, along with the following libraries:

Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn
You can install these libraries using pip package manager:

Copy code
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
Dataset
We will be using a dataset that contains historical stock prices of a particular company. The dataset contains the following columns:

Date: Date of the stock price
Open: Opening price of the stock
High: Highest price of the stock
Low: Lowest price of the stock
Close: Closing price of the stock
Volume: Total number of stocks traded that day
Name: Name of the company
The dataset can be downloaded from Yahoo Finance.

Project Structure
The project contains the following files and directories:

data/: This directory contains the dataset in CSV format.
models/: This directory contains trained machine learning models.
notebooks/: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks that were used to develop and train the machine learning models.
scripts/: This directory contains Python scripts that can be used to train and test the machine learning models.
README.md: This file.
Running the Code
To train and test the machine learning models, run the following command from the project directory:

bash
Copy code
python scripts/train_test.py
This will train and test the machine learning models on the provided dataset. The trained models will be saved in the models/ directory.

To predict stock prices using the trained models, run the following command from the project directory:

bash
Copy code
python scripts/predict.py
This will use the trained models to predict future stock prices. The predicted prices will be displayed on the screen.
